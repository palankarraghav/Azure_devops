Hi Team,

1. AKS is deployed in one virtual network. And key vault is linked to aks for to manage secrets.

2. Vnet is integrated with Application gateway which is intern linked with DNS zone.

3. AKS have deployments for frontend application, backend application and chat handling service

4. Stateful set applications are deployed for database, Queue handlind service and Redis cache

5. Flow work in a way where blog is posted from frontend application which calls backend API, backend api creates the
    request and pushes to queue handling service. Queue listner picks request from queue and sends approval mail.

6. Approver receives approval mail, Once approver approves using the link. That link gets dns resolved gets 
    application gateways public ip, reaches gateway, by backednd pool it reaches aks's nginx controller,
    from there it reaches queue lister where queue listner updates database entry.

7. Azure disks are created managed by aks once pvc is created and deployed into aks.

8. TLS termination and web security is ensured at gateway.

9. TLS is added on ingress controller also where cert-manager deploys certificate as secret which will get used 
    by ingress.

10. Chat services publishes updates to redis cache.

11. Only Approval service is exposed via application gateway rest all is kept private.

12. Azure monitoring, Promethus and grafana are enabled on aks for monitoring purposes.

13. Access is controlled using both Azure RBAC and Role bindings.

14. CI is created to build the image, scan it and then push to Azure container registry.

15. CD is created in a way to deploy manifests to aks by picking latest ACR images pushed by CI.
